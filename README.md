We referred to various youtube channels and sites for this project.

Bootstrap
The theme for our website was esports and we believe that our website justifies and fits perfectly in the theme because it provides players with a platform to take part in various tournaments of games of their choice.


We had a tough time putting various sections of the code together on git and making the website as a whole responsive. However, using media queries and bootstrap and a few hours, we overcame this issue to the best of our capabilities.
We learnt about new text animations and designing navigation bars,cars,carousels.
